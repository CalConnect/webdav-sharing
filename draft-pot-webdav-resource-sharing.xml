                This specification defines an extension to WebDAV that enables the sharing of
                resources between users on a WebDAV server.
            </t>

        <section title='Introduction'>

            <t>
                Users of <xref target="RFC4791">CalDAV</xref> and
                <xref target="RFC6352">CardDAV</xref> often require a
                mechanism to share a calendar or address book collection
                with other users.
            </t>
            <t>
                This specification introduces a mechanism that allows
                users of WebDAV servers to invite another user to share a
                resource or WebDAV collection. The invited user can either
                accept or reject the invite, which is communicated back to the
                sharer. If the user chooses to accept the invite, the shared
                resource will then appear in a location on the server that's
                accessible by the invitee.
            </t>
            <t>
                There are existing mechanism that address similar use-cases,
                such as using <xref target='RFC3744'>WebDAV ACL</xref> for
                fine-grained access control. Experiences has shown that client
                developers are averse to using it due its complexity. Many
                implementations have chosen to only use WebDAV ACL for
                communicating access control information to clients, but not
                for modification. WebDAV ACL alone also does not provide the
                means for a user to invite another user.
            </t>
            <t>
                HTTP POST operations are used to manage the sharing invitations
                and replies, and WebDAV properties are used to expose the state
                of shared resources.
            </t>
            <t>
                This specification uses WebDAV notifications to communicate to
                users there are outstanding invitations, or responses to
                invitations.

        <section title='High-level overview' anchor='overview'>
            <t>
                This section provides a basic overview of this protocol by way
                of a simple use case of a sharer sharing a collection with a
                single sharee.
            </t>
            <t>
                To share a resource with another user, the sharer's client
                executes an HTTP POST request against the resource that's to
                be shared. The POST request body will contain details of the
                user to whom the resource is to be shared as well as the
                access right to be granted to them. If the request succeeds, a
                notification is sent to the sharee with details of the
                resource being shared to them.
            </t>
            <t>
                The sharer's client will show the notification to the sharee
                and present them with the choice to accept or decline the
                invitation to the shared collection. If the sharee chooses to
                decline, then nothing changes for that sharee. If the sharee
                chooses to accept, then a new resource is created at a
                location that's accessible to the sharee.
                The server enforces the appropriate access privileges for the
                sharee.
            </t>
            <t>
                At any time, the sharer can inspect properties on the
                resource being shared, and determine the accept/decline
                status of each sharee. Additional sharees can be added and
                existing ones removed. The access privileges for existing
                sharees can also be changed.
            </t>
            <t>
                Once a sharee has access to the shared resource, they can
                remove it and decline the sharing invite by simply having
                their client issue an HTTP DELETE request on the shared
                collection. That does not delete any data, but rather simply
                removes the "link" to the sharer's resource and sets the
                sharee's invite status to declined.
            </t>

          <section title="Advertising resource sharing support">
            <t>
                A server that supports the features described in this
                document MUST include "resource-sharing" as a field in the
                DAV response header from an OPTIONS request on any resource
                that supports these features.
            </t>
            <t>
                A response to this OPTIONS request might look as follows:

          <section title="Required privileges">
            <t>
              A server that supports sharing on a specific resource, MUST
              enforce this using the "DAV:share" privilege. Privileges are
              defined in <xref target="RFC3744" />.
            </t>
            <t>
              The privilege MUST be non-abstract and MAY be protected. This
              privilege MUST appear in the DAV:supported-privilege-set
              property for resources that may be shared. In addition, it MUST
              appear in the DAV:current-user-privilege-set property, if the
              user is in fact allowed to share the resource. This mechanism
              is also used by a client to discover sharing capabilities on
              specific resources.
            </t>
          </section>
          <section title="Sharing POST request">
            <t>
              To share a resource or revoke access to a shared resource, the
              client must issue a POST request to the resource that the user
              wants to share. The POST request MUST contain an XML document as
              its body, with the root element being <xref target="DAV:share-resource" />
            </t>
            <t>
              The POST request MUST contain a Content-Type HTTP header, which
              MUST contain "application/davshare+xml" as its value. Servers
              SHOULD reject the request if this is not the case.
            </t>
            <t>
              The DAV:share-resource element can contain one or more DAV:sharee
              elements. Each DAV:sharee element MUST at least have a
              DAV:href element containing a URI identifying the sharee.
            </t>
            <t>
              The URI in DAV:href may be a principal-URL referring to a
              sharee host on the same server, an email address or any other URI
              identifying a user. In the case of the latter two, the sharee might not
              be a user on the same server - though in that case how invitations are
              sent or access is enabled is out of scope for this specification.
            </t>
            <t>
              The DAV:prop element is optional, and can be used to provide more
              information about the sharee. The server MAY use this information and
              later return it when information is requested about the list of sharees.
              Any valid WebDAV property might be provided here, but it's up to the
              discretion of the server what to support.
              A client SHOULD provide at least a DAV:displayname property as a human-
              readable string identifying the user.
            </t>
            <t>
              The DAV:share-access element is required. It MUST contain one of the
              following elements:

        <section title="Handling the share process">

          <t>
            This specification supports two major processes for sharing a resource.
            The server can either immediately set up the newly shared resource, or
            the server can provide an invitation process. The former might be useful
            in  small trusted team settings, whereas the invitation process might be
            used in public servers, where it's desirable for users to explicitly
            opt-in to getting access to newly shared resources.
          </t>
          <t>
            This specification provides a invitation and notification mechanism.
            It might also be possible that servers provide their own out-of-band
            mechanism for this, but this should not affect clients.
          </t>

          <section title="The invitation process">
            <t>
              If the server opts to support the standard invitation process, the
              server MUST support <!-- <xref target="dav-notifcations"-->WebDAV
              notifications<!-- </xref> -->.
            </t>
            <t>
              Sharees for a resource MUST appear up in the DAV:invite property.
              Each sharee will have one of the following elements:
              <list style="hanging">
                <t hangText="DAV:invite-noresponse">The sharee was invited, but has not yet responded to the invite.</t>
                <t hangText="DAV:invite-accepted">The sharee has accepted the invite.</t>
                <t hangText="DAV:invite-declined">The sharee has declined the invite.</t>
                <t hangText="DAV:invite-invalid">The invitation was invalid or could not be delivered.</t>
              </list>
            </t>
            <t>
              When sharees are initially invited, they will get the DAV:invite-noresponse status.
              When a sharee's access has been changed, they will retain their existing status.
              When a sharee's access has been revoked, they will no longer appear in the DAV:invite property.
            </t>
            <t>
              After any of these mutations, sharees receive an <xref target="invite-notification" /> in their
              notification collection. After the sharee has accepted or declined the invite, their status
              will reflect this response.
            </t>
          </section>

          <section title="Instant sharing">

            <t>
              Implementing the invitation process is optional. It's also possible for servers
              to immediately apply changes. The effect is that no notifications may be needed,
              and the server behaves as if sharees immediately accept invitations.
              Sharees listed in DAV:invite might immediately receive a DAV:invite-accepted status.
            </t>

          </section>

        </section>

        <section title="Notification Definitions">
            <t>
                In order to facilitate the process of sharing invitations, this
                specification uses <!-- <xref target="dav-notifications">-->WebDAV
                notifications<!-- </xref> -->, and defines several new notification
                types.
            </t>
            <section title="Invite Notification" anchor='invite-notification'>
                <t>
                    When a sharer adds a new sharee to a resource, or updates
                    a sharee, an invite notification is added to the sharee's
                    notification collection.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The notification contains information about the shared
                    resource, the owner and how to respond to the invitation.

                        them on the change in the sharee state. This is
                        accomplished by sending a

                        For privacy reasons, sharees need to be able to
                        remove invitations without notifiying the sharer.

                        When the sharee issues a DELETE on an
                        invite-notification, the server MUST remove the

                        remain as DAV:invite-noreply.

                        request is received the server MUST remove the shared
                        collection and automatically update the sharee's

                    <t>
                        Servers MUST support "per-instance" WebDAV properties
                        on shared resource and MAY support them on resources
                        within shared collections. A "per-instance" WebDAV
                        property is one whose value can be set and retrieved
                        on an instance of a resource, but is not
                        automatically propagated to other instances of the
                        same shared resource. For example, a sharee may
                        change a property on their instance of a shared
                        resource, but the instance of the owner of the
                        resource will not see this updated value.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        For shared resources, the server MUST allow all
                        users to write "per-instance" WebDAV properties on the
                        shared resources and MAY allow property writes on
                        resources within the shared resources. This is
                        required even in the case where the sharee has been
                        granted read access only (i.e., the ability to
                        change the resource is disallowed). This requirement
                        ensures that sharees can always change "personal"
                        properties such as display names.

            <t>
                This specification is based on an earlier effort, often referred
                to as 'caldav-sharing'. It is possible to remain compatibile with
                this specification, but it's important to be aware of a number of
                changes.
            </t>
            <t>
                The earlier draft uses the http://calendarserver.org/ns/
                namespace for all its xml elements. This means that any
                WebDAV property introduced in this specification, may need
                to have a similar property in the old namespace.
            </t>
            <t>
                XML documents as sent by POST requests and responses, and
                resources returned from notifications can be distinguished by
                the use of the Content-Type and Accept HTTP headers. The earlier
                draft does not define new mime-types for these, but this
                specification does.
