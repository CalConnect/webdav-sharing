1.  Introduction

   It is often useful for servers to communicate arbitrary information
   to the end-users for a WebDAV system, such as a system status,
   message of the day or to notify users of changes that were made to
   shared resources by other users.

                        WebDAV User Notifications              June 2014


   This specification defines a generic "notification" mechanism that
   allows a server to do that.  Whilst primarily aimed at CalDAV
   [RFC4791] and CardDAV [RFC6352] this mechanism has been designed to
   be adaptable to other applications of WebDAV [RFC4918].

2.  Open Issues

   1.  Define specific child elements for system status notification,
       e.g. "server-maintenance-period", "server-read-only-period",
       "client-upgrade-required".

   2.  I would like to propose the possibility of using webdav
       properties for the full payload of the notification messages.
       Advantages of this model are that we can now use PROPFIND or
       WebDAV sync to get the full payload for notifications.

   3.  If this is not desired, we should define mimetypes and discuss
       the Accept header.

   4.  Is the usage of dtstamp appropriate?  Can we just Last-Modified
       semantics instead?

   5.  Consider simplifying systemstatus.  Could we drop the attribute?

3.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   When XML element types in the namespaces "DAV:" is referenced in this
   document outside of the context of an XML fragment, the string "DAV:"
   will be prefixed to the element type name.

4.  Requirements Overview

   To add support for WebDAV notifications, a server MUST at least have
   support for WebDAV Class 3 [RFC4918].

   WebDAV notifications also defines new properties on principal
   resources, which are defined in RFC3744 [RFC3744].

5.  Notifications

   When this feature is available, a DAV:notification-URL
   (Section 5.1.1) property appears on principal resources for those
   principals who are able to receive notifications.  That property
   specifies a single DAV:href element whose content refers to a WebDAV

   collection resource.  Notification "messages" are deposited into this
   collection and can be retrieved by clients and acted on accordingly.

   The notification collection referenced by the DAV:notification-URL
   (Section 5.1.1) property MUST have a DAV:resourcetype property with
   DAV:collection and DAV:notifications (Section 5.3.1) child elements.

   Notification "messages" are XML documents stored as resources in the
   notification collection.  Each XML document contains a
   DAV:notification (Section 5.3.2) element as its root.  The root
   element contains a DAV:dtstamp element, and one additional element
   which represents the type of notification being conveyed in the
   message.  That child element will typically contain additional
   content that describes the notification.

   Each notification resource has a DAV:notificationtype (Section 5.2.1)
   property which contains as its single child element an empty element
   that matches the child element of the notification resource XML
   document root.  Any attributes on the child element in the XML
   document are also present in the property child element.

   Notifications are automatically generated by the server with an
   appropriate resource stored in the notifications collection of the
   user to whom the notification is targeted.  Clients SHOULD monitor
   the notification collection looking for new notification resources.
   When doing so, clients SHOULD look at the DAV:notificationtype
   (Section 5.2.1) property to ensure that the notification is of a type
   that the client can handle.  Once a client has handled the
   notification in whatever way is appropriate it SHOULD delete the
   notification resource.  Clients SHOULD remove notifications being
   displayed to a user when the notification resource is removed from
   the notification collection, to enable the user to dismiss a
   notification on one device and have it automatically removed from
   others.  Clients MUST ignore all notifications for types they do not
   recognize.  Servers MAY delete notification resources on their own if
   they determine that the notifications are no longer relevant or
   valid.  Servers MAY coalesce notifications as appropriate.

   Servers MUST prevent clients from adding resources in the
   notification collection.

5.1.  Additional Principal Properties

   This section defines new properties for WebDAV principal resources as
   defined in RFC3744 [RFC3744].  These properties are likely to be
   protected but the server MAY allow them to be written by appropriate
   users.

                        WebDAV User Notifications              June 2014


5.1.1.  DAV:notification-URL Property

   Name:  notification-URL

   Namespace:  DAV:

   Purpose:  Identify the URL of the notification collection owned by
      the associated principal resource.

   Protected:  This property SHOULD be protected.

   PROPFIND behavior:  This property SHOULD NOT be returned by a
      PROPFIND allprop request (as defined in Section 14.2 of
      [RFC4918]).

   COPY/MOVE behavior:  This property value SHOULD be preserved in COPY
      and MOVE operations.

   Description:  This property is needed for a client to determine where
      the notification collection of the current user is located so that
      processing of notification messages can occur.  If not present,
      then the associated calendar user is not enabled for notification
      messages on the server.

   Definition:

   <!ELEMENT notification-URL (DAV:href)>

5.2.  Properties on Notification Resources

   The following new WebDAV properties are defined for notification
   resources.

5.2.1.  DAV:notificationtype Property

   Name:  notificationtype

   Namespace:  DAV:

   Purpose:  Identify the type of notification of the corresponding
      resource.

   Protected:  This property MUST be protected.

   PROPFIND behavior:  This property SHOULD NOT be returned by a
      PROPFIND allprop request (as defined in Section 14.2 of
      [RFC4918]).

                        WebDAV User Notifications              June 2014


   COPY/MOVE behavior:  This property value MUST be preserved in COPY
      and MOVE operations.

   Description:  This property allows a client, via a PROPFIND Depth:1
      request, to quickly find notification messages that the client can
      handle in a notification collection.  The single child element is
      the notification resource root element's child defining the
      notification itself.  This element MUST be empty, though any
      attributes on the element in the notification resource MUST be
      present in the property element.

   Definition:

   <!ELEMENT notificationtype ANY>
   <!-- Child elements are empty but will have appropriate attributes.
        Any valid notification message child element can appear.-->

5.3.  XML Element Definitions

5.3.1.  DAV:notifications

   Name:  notifications

   Namespace:  DAV:

   Purpose:  Indicates a notification collection.

   Description:  This XML element is used in a DAV:resourcetype element
      to indicate that the corresponding resource is a notification
      collection.

   Definition:

   <!ELEMENT notifications EMPTY>

5.3.2.  DAV:notification

   Name:  notification

   Namespace:  DAV:

   Purpose:  Notification message root element.

   Description:  The root element used in notification resources.

   Definition:

                        WebDAV User Notifications              June 2014


   <!ELEMENT notification (dtstamp, XXX) >
   <!-- Any notification type element can appear after
        DAV:dtstamp -->

5.3.3.  DAV:dtstamp

   Name:  dtstamp

   Namespace:  DAV:

   Purpose:  Date-time stamp.

   Description:  Contains the date-time stamp corresponding to the
      creation of a notification message, using the format defined in
      [RFC3339], or the "compact" format without "-" and ":" characters
      between date and time elements, respectively.

   Definition:

   <!ELEMENT dtstamp (#PCDATA)>
   <!-- Value is a date-time in UTZ as per [RFC3339] with
        "compact" format allowed.-->

6.  Notification Definitions

   This section defines a set of common notification types.

6.1.  System Status Notification

   The system status notification is used to convey a URI and/or textual
   description to the user.  The assumption is that the URI points to a
   webpage where current system status is described in detail, with the
   provided description being a summary of that.  A "type" attribute on
   the element is used to indicate the importance of the current status
   notification, and has the values "low", "medium" and "high",
   representing the increasing level of importance of the message
   respectively.

   Servers might have knowledge of specific calendar user language
   preferences, in which case it MAY localise the DAV:description value
   as appropriate based on the calendar user accessing the notification,
   but if it does, it SHOULD include an xml:lang attribute on the
   DAV:description element to indicate what language is being used.

6.1.1.  DAV:systemstatus Element Definition

   Name:  systemstatus

   Namespace:  DAV:

   Purpose:  Indicates a system status notification.

   Description:  This XML element is used in a DAV:notification element
      to describe a system status notification.

   Definition:

   <!ELEMENT systemstatus (DAV:href?, DAV:description?)>
   <!ATTLIST systemstatus type (low | medium | high) "low">

     <!ELEMENT description CDATA>

   <!-- One of DAV:href of DAV:description MUST be present -->

   Example:  This is an example of the body of a notification resource
      for an emergency system outage:

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <D:notification xmlns:D="DAV:">
     <D:dtstamp>2011-12-09T11:12:53-05:00</D:dtstamp>
     <D:systemstatus type="high">
       <D:href>http://example.com/emergency_shutdown.html</D:href>
       <D:description xml:lang='en_US'
       >Emergency shutdown now</D:description>
     </D:systemstatus>
   </D:notification>

   Example:  This is an example of the WebDAV property on the example
      notification resource above:

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <D:notificationtype xmlns:D="DAV:">
     <D:systemstatus type="high" />
   </D:notificationtype>

7.  Security Considerations

   TBD: More?

Appendix A.  Backwards-compatibility with earlier drafts

   An earlier draft of this specification is already widely deployed
   among both servers and clients.

   This specification, informally known as 'caldav-notifications'
   largely uses the same structure as this specification, but where the
   "DAV:" xml namespace is used in this specification, the earlier draft
   uses "http://calendarserver.org/ns/".

   This makes it possible to create two separate collections for
   notifications, as each is discovered by the user using their own
   respective "notification-URL" property on the principal.
