1.  Introduction

   Users of CalDAV [RFC4791] often require a mechanism to share a
   calendar with other users.

   In the past this use-case has been fulfilled by non-standard means.
   This specification aims to describe a standard way for clients and
   servers to share calendars.

   Sharing calendars is for the most part completely implemented using
   draft-pot-webdav-resource-sharing, but there are a few considerations
   specific to CalDAV to ensure that mechanisms such as scheduling still
   behaves as expected.

2.  Open Issues

   1.  Do we need feature discovery for this spec?

   2.  DAV:owner requirement for scheduling.  I think this is
       problematic...

   3.  I don't think we should allow sharees that have access to an
       invite for which they are the attendee for, via the organizers
       shared calendar, to allow them to make attendee-related changes.
       The entire collection should operate as if the operation is on
       behalf of the organizer.

3.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   When XML element types in the namespaces "DAV:" and
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:caldav" are referenced in this document

   outside of the context of an XML fragment, the string "DAV:" and
   "CALDAV:" will be prefixed to the element type names respectively.

   Terms Used:

   Sharer  ...

4.  Calendar sharing

   While the draft-pot-webdav-resource-sharing specification allows
   sharing of potentially any resource on a server, this specification
   only concerns itself with sharing calendar collections, as defined in
   CalDAV [RFC4791].

   Sharing of resources other than calendar collections is not addressed
   in this specification.

5.  Per-instance calendar data

   Servers that support calendar sharing MUST support "per-instance"
   calendar data in calendar object resources stored in shared
   calendars.  This allows each sharee and the sharer to store their own
   alarms and free busy transparency status without "interfering" with
   other users who also have access to the same calendar object
   resources.

   For calendaring object resources in shared calendar collections, the
   server MUST treat the following iCalendar data objects as per-
   instance:

      TRANSP property

      VALARM component

6.  Scheduling

   CalDAV Scheduling [RFC6638] defines how a CalDAV server carries out
   scheduling operations when calendar object resources are created,
   modified or deleted and include "ORGANIZER" and "ATTENDEE" iCalendar
   properties.

   When calendar object resources are created, modified or deleted in
   shared calendars by sharees, the following restrictions apply:

   1.  The "ORGANIZER" iCalendar property value in the iCalendar data
       MUST match a calendar user address of the sharer (owner) of the
       shared calendar.  The DAV:owner WebDAV property MUST be present
       on a shared calendar and MUST provide a reference to a principal-

       URL of the sharer (owner) of the shared calendar.  Clients can
       use this value to determine what the allowed "ORGANIZER"
       iCalendar property values are.  The server MUST reject any
       attempt by a sharee to create an iCalendar component with an
       "ORGANIZER" property value other than the sharer (owner) of the
       shared calendar.

   2.  The server MUST reject any attempt by a sharee to MOVE a calendar
       object resource in a shared calendar to some other collection.

   3.  When a sharee is listed as an Attendee in a calendar object
       resource in a shared calendar, and write access is granted, the
       sharee is allowed to change not only iCalendar data related to
       the Organizer, but also data related to the Attendee. i.e., a
       sharee can change their own participation status on the
       "ATTENDEE" iCalendar property referring to them.  Additionally,
       if the sharee is not listed as an Attendee, and write access is
       granted, the sharee can add themselves as an Attendee.

   4.  The default calendar collection defined in Section 6.3 of
       [RFC6638] MUST NOT be a calendar shared to the corresponding
       calendar user.

   Following are additional considerations for scheduling with shared
   calendars:

   1.  A scheduled iCalendar component could appear in more than one
       calendar collection within a sharee's calendar home if the sharee
       is an Attendee and the Organizer or other Attendees have shared a
       calendar with the sharee that includes their copies of the
       iCalendar component.  It is important to note that the scheduled
       component in the shared calendar could have different access
       rights than the one in the sharee's owned calendar.

   2.  A scheduled iCalendar component appearing in a sharee's shared
       calendar could include the sharee as an Attendee.  For recurring
       events, it is possible for the sharee to only be listed as an
       Attendee in some instances, as opposed to all.  Clients will need
       to be aware of this when allowing sharee's to set their own
       participation status.

   3.  In addition, when a shared calendar is first accepted by a
       sharee, the server SHOULD set the CALDAV:schedule-calendar-transp
       property to the value CALDAV:transparent to ensure newly accepted
       shared calendars do not contribute to the sharee's freebusy time
       until the sharee explicitly requests it.
