                This specification defines sharing calendars between users on
                a CalDAV server.

            <t>
                Users of <xref target="RFC4791">CalDAV</xref> often require a
                mechanism to share a calendar with other users.
            </t>
            <t>
                In the past this use-case has been fulfilled by non-standard
                means. This specification aims to describe a standard way for
                clients and servers to share calendars.
            </t>
            <t>
                Sharing calendars is for the most part completely implemented
                using <!--<xref target="-->draft-pot-webdav-resource-sharing<!--" />-->,
                but there are a few considerations specific to CalDAV to ensure
                that mechanisms such as scheduling still behaves as expected.

            <t>
              While the <!--<xref target="-->draft-pot-webdav-resource-sharing<!--" />-->
              specification allows sharing of potentially any resource on a
              server, this specification only concerns itself with sharing
              calendar collections, as defined in <xref target="RFC4791">CalDAV</xref>.
            </t>
            <t>
                Sharing of resources other than calendar collections is not
                addressed in this specification.
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title='Per-instance calendar data' anchor="per-instance-calendar-data">
            <t>
                Servers that support calendar sharing MUST support "per-instance"
                calendar data in calendar object resources stored in shared
                calendars. This allows each sharee and the sharer to store
                their own alarms and free busy transparency status without
                "interfering" with other users who also have access to the
                same calendar object resources.
            </t>
            <t>
                For calendaring object resources in shared calendar
                collections, the server MUST treat the following iCalendar
                data objects as per-instance:
            </t>
            <t>
              <list style="empty">
                <t>TRANSP property</t>
                <t>VALARM component</t>
              </list>
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title='Scheduling' anchor="scheduling">
            <t>
                <xref target="RFC6638">CalDAV Scheduling</xref> defines how a
                CalDAV server carries out scheduling operations when calendar
                object resources are created, modified or deleted and include
                "ORGANIZER" and "ATTENDEE" iCalendar properties.
            </t>
            <t>
              When a user interacts with a shared instance of a calendar, the
              agent and server must operate as if the operation is done on
              behalf of the original sharer of the calendar. 
            </t>
            <t>
              That means that if a new scheduling resource is created, the
              server MUST operate as if the calendar is a normal non-shared
              calendar owned by the sharee. This means that when doing
              scheduling operations on a shared calendar, the agents don't
              act on behalf of the original instance.
            </t>
            <t>
              If a user is creating a new scheduling resource on a shared
              calendar, and an ATTENDEE listed on the scheduling resource
              also owns an instance of the shared calendar, the server MAY
              not create a new resource for the ATTENDEE. This is to avoid
              events appearing multiple times in a user's calendars.
            </t>
            <t>
              A shared calendar MAY be specified in a user's
              CALDAV:schedule-default-calendar-url.
            </t>
            <t>
              A user that appears as an ATTENDEE in a calendar object resource
              in a shared calendar, and DAV:read-write access is granted,
              the sharee is allowed to change not only iCalendar data
              related to the Organizer, but also data related to the
              Attendee. i.e., a sharee can change their own participation
              status on the "ATTENDEE" iCalendar property referring to
              them.  Additionally, if the sharee is not listed as an
              Attendee, and write access is granted, the sharee can add
              themselves as an Attendee.
            </t>
            <t>
                Following are additional considerations for scheduling with
                shared calendars:
            </t>
            <t>
              <list style="numbers">
                <t>
                    A scheduled iCalendar component could appear in more than
                    one calendar collection within a sharee's calendar home if
                    the sharee is an Attendee and the Organizer or other
                    Attendees have shared a calendar with the sharee that
                    includes their copies of the iCalendar component. It is
                    important to note that the scheduled component in the
                    shared calendar could have different access rights than
                    the one in the sharee's owned calendar.
                </t>
                <t>
                    A scheduled iCalendar component appearing in a sharee's
                    shared calendar could include the sharee as an Attendee. 
                    For recurring events, it is possible for the sharee to
                    only be listed as an Attendee in some instances, as opposed
                    to all.  Clients will need to be aware of this when
                    allowing sharee's to set their own participation status.
                </t>
                <t>
                    In addition, when a shared calendar is first accepted by a
                    sharee, the server SHOULD set the
                    CALDAV:schedule-calendar-transp property to the value
                    CALDAV:transparent to ensure newly accepted shared
                    calendars do not contribute to the sharee's freebusy time
                    until the sharee explicitly requests it.
                </t>
