            <t>
                Users of <xref target="RFC6352">CardDAV</xref> often require a
                mechanism to share an address book with other users.
            </t>
            <t>
                Sharing address books is for the most part completely implemented
                using <!--<xref target="-->draft-pot-webdav-resource-sharing<!--" />-->,
                but there are a few considerations specific to CardDAV to ensure
                that certain mechanisms still behaves as expected.

            <t>
              While the <!--<xref target="-->draft-pot-webdav-resource-sharing<!--" />-->
              specification allows sharing of potentially any resource on a
              server, this specification only concerns itself with sharing
              address book collections, as defined in <xref target="RFC6352">CardDAV</xref>.
            </t>
            <t>
                Sharing of resources other than address book collections is not
                addressed in this specification.
            </t>

        <section title="Handling multiple copies of a contact">

          <t>
            vCard are often distributed via email, and two users of a CardDAV
            might have a copy of the same vCard.
          </t>
          <t>
            When those two users now share an addressbook, they might end up
            with two vCards that describe the same person.
          </t>
          <t>
            Some address book user agents coalesce two vCards from different
            addressbooks to show up as one (merged) vCard to an end user.
            These clients SHOULD ensure that when an update is made to a merged
            vCard, all instances of that vCard are updated if the user agent
            has read-write access.
          </t>
          <t>
            In case two vCards have conflicting information, the information
            from the vCard with the highest value for the REV property should
            be used.
