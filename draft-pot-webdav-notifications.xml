                This specification defines an extension to WebDAV that allows the server to provide notifications to users.

        <section title='Introduction'>
            <t>
                It is often useful for servers to communicate arbitrary
                information to the end-users for a WebDAV system, such as a
                system status, message of the day or to notify users of
                changes that were made to shared resources by other users.
           </t>
           <t>
               This specification defines a generic "notification" mechanism
               that allows a server to do that. Whilst primarily aimed at
               <xref target="RFC4791">CalDAV</xref> and <xref target="RFC6352">CardDAV</xref>
               this mechanism has been designed to be adaptable to other
               applications of <xref target='RFC4918'>WebDAV</xref>.
           </t>
        </section>

        <section title='Conventions Used in This Document'>
            <t>
                The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target='RFC2119' />.
            </t>
            <t>
                When XML element types in the namespaces "DAV:" is referenced
                in this document outside of the context of an XML fragment,
                the string "DAV:" will be prefixed to the element type name.
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Requirements Overview">
            <t>
                To add support for WebDAV notifications, a server MUST at
                least have support for <xref target="RFC4918">WebDAV Class 3</xref>.
            </t>
            <t>
                WebDAV notifications also defines new properties on principal
                resources, which are defined in <xref target="RFC3744">RFC3744</xref>.
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Notifications">
            <t>When this feature is available, a <xref target="DAV:notification-URL">DAV:notification-URL</xref> property appears on principal resources for those principals who are able to receive notifications. That property specifies a single DAV:href element whose content refers to a WebDAV collection resource. Notification "messages" are deposited into this collection and can be retrieved by clients and acted on accordingly.</t>
            <t>The notification collection referenced by the <xref target="DAV:notification-URL">DAV:notification-URL</xref> property MUST have a DAV:resourcetype property with DAV:collection and <xref target="DAV:notifications">DAV:notifications</xref> child elements.</t>
            <t>Notification "messages" are XML documents stored as resources in the notification collection. Each XML document contains a <xref target="DAV:notification">DAV:notification</xref> element as its root. The root element contains a DAV:dtstamp element, and one additional element which represents the type of notification being conveyed in the message. That child element will typically contain additional content that describes the notification.</t>
            <t>Each notification resource has a <xref target="DAV:notificationtype">DAV:notificationtype</xref> property which contains as its single child element an empty element that matches the child element of the notification resource XML document root. Any attributes on the child element in the XML document are also present in the property child element.</t>
            <t>Notifications are automatically generated by the server with an appropriate resource stored in the notifications collection of the user to whom the notification is targeted. Clients SHOULD monitor the notification collection looking for new notification resources. When doing so, clients SHOULD look at the <xref target="DAV:notificationtype">DAV:notificationtype</xref> property to ensure that the notification is of a type that the client can handle. Once a client has handled the notification in whatever way is appropriate it SHOULD delete the notification resource. Clients SHOULD remove notifications being displayed to a user when the notification resource is removed from the notification collection, to enable the user to dismiss a notification on one device and have it automatically removed from others. Clients MUST ignore all notifications for types they do not recognize. Servers MAY delete notification resources on their own if they determine that the notifications are no longer relevant or valid. Servers MAY coalesce notifications as appropriate.</t>
            <t>Servers MUST prevent clients from adding resources in the notification collection.</t>
            <section title="Mime type" anchor="mime-type">
                <t>
                    The "application/davnotification+xml" MIME media type MUST
                    be used for transfer of WebDAV notifications.

                </t>
                <t>
                    HTTP GET requests that expect to receive a WebDAV
                    notification resource, SHOULD include an "Accept" header
                    that includes "application/davnotification+xml".

                <t>

                <t>This section defines new properties for WebDAV principal resources as defined in <xref target="RFC3744">RFC3744</xref>. These properties are likely to be protected but the server MAY allow them to be written by appropriate users.</t>

            <t>
                An earlier draft of this specification is already widely
                deployed among both servers and clients.
            </t>
            <t>
                This specification, informally known as 'caldav-notifications'
                largely uses the same structure as this specification, but
                where the "DAV:" xml namespace is used in this specification,
                the earlier draft uses "http://calendarserver.org/ns/".
            </t>
            <t>
                It is possible to conform to both that draft and this
                specification by either creating two different collections, as
                identified by "notification-URL" in each respective namespace.
                Alternatively it's possible to use the same resource for
                both, but use content-negotation using the Accept header to
                ask the server for a specific representation of a notification.
